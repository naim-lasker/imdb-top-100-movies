        IMDb, also known as Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information related to world films, television programs,
        home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew, personnel and fictional character
        biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings. An additional fan feature, message boards, was
        abandoned in February, 2017. The database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. As of
        December 2017, IMDb has approximately 4.7 million titles (including episodes) and 8.3 million personalities in its
        database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users. The movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet
        users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.
